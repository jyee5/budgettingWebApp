<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Web Application, youTrack was designed to ease the idea of budgetting, and saving money.  Many people can budget or track their expenses via Excel, or Google Sheets, but this is more complex than it seems with a lot of manual input and manual visualizations.  With the web application my partner and I created, it will have basic input of expenses and income, and will show the visualization that is necessary to track your expenses.  

These include...
* Pie Chart for the current months expense
* Bar Chart for the yearly expense, to visualize overtime
